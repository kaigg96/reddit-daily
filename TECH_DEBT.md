# Tech debt & code health

Tracks the recurring code-quality check-in the owner asked for after every
project version: read through the codebase, find the highest-leverage
non-functional improvements (structure, duplication, fundamentals), fix what's
approved, defer the rest with reasoning. This is a companion to
[PRD.md](PRD.md) — PRD.md tracks *feature* requirements and their status;
this file tracks *code health* independent of any feature phase.

## Pass 1 — 2026-07-21 (after v3 + R4.2 shipped)

### Addressed

**Dead code/assets removed:**
- `assets/question.mp3`, `assets/top_responses.mp3` — unused since R1.1 removed the "announcer" segments (dead air elimination).
- `audio_adjustment.ipynb` — one-time notebook, its job (lowering `funk_bg.mp3`, generating the now-deleted announcer clips) is done; was gitignored, never committed.
- iCloud sync-conflict duplicate files (`scripts/analyze_channel 2.py`, `analysis/*` " 2" copies) — byte-identical junk from the repo living in an iCloud-synced folder.

**Duplication removed — new `src/analytics.py`:**
- `median()` was copy-pasted verbatim in three scripts (`analyze_channel.py`, `weekly_analytics.py`, `weekly_digest.py`). Now one function.
- Three separate implementations of "paginate the channel's uploads playlist" (one via raw REST + API key, two via OAuth client, each with slightly different pagination loop code) consolidated into `list_uploaded_videos()` + `fetch_video_details()`.
- `analyze_channel.py` migrated off its standalone API-key auth path onto the same OAuth client the other two reporting scripts already used — this was the right call when written (R4.3 shipped before the Phase 3 OAuth re-auth existed), but became a redundant second auth mechanism once that re-auth landed. Removed the hardcoded `CHANNEL_ID` constant along with it; the channel is now always resolved live via `channels().list(mine=True)`, the same as everywhere else.

**Structural split — `src/video.py` (351 lines, three unrelated concerns) →**
- `src/video.py` — timeline assembly, captions, MoviePy rendering.
- `src/background.py` — procedural drifting-glow generator + b-roll/procedural selection.
- `src/thumbnail.py` — Pillow-based thumbnail card (shares no code with the MoviePy path; different library entirely).

**Correctness/clarity fix:**
- `src/run.py`: `Segment` objects were constructed with `kind=""` and mutated right after (`segments[0].kind = "title"`). `synth()` now takes `kind` directly — removes the two-step construction.

**Docs synced** to match: README's pipeline walkthrough and OAuth section (which had gone stale — it still listed the already-completed OAuth re-auth as an open task), PRD.md's R4.3 entries and OQ-4.

### Considered, not done (with reasoning)

- **Pulling caption font-sizes/y-positions in `video.py`/`thumbnail.py` into `config.py`.** These are single-call-site layout values; indirecting them through a config lookup would make the call sites *less* readable, not more. `config.py` already correctly holds values that are genuinely reused across call sites (`BRAND_ORANGE`, `CAPTION_WIDTH`, etc.) — that's the right bar, not "every literal."
- **Type hints / mypy / ruff.** Legitimate for a team codebase; disproportionate process overhead for a solo-maintained project at this size. Revisit if the codebase or contributor count grows.
- **Deleting `create_video.ipynb`.** Harmless either way — kept "for reference" per the owner's earlier call, not a code-health issue. Owner's call whenever.
- **Promoting `weekly_analytics.py`/`weekly_digest.py` into a `src/analytics/` subpackage** (run via `python -m`, mirroring `src/run.py`) instead of staying in `scripts/` importing from a shared module. Considered as the structurally "purer" option; owner chose to keep `scripts/` as-is (no workflow YAML changes, no command-muscle-memory churn) with the new `src/analytics.py` doing the actual DRY work. Revisit if `scripts/` accumulates more CI-invoked entries and the asymmetry starts to grate.

### Deferred to a future pass

- **No automated tests exist.** Not urgent for the rendering path (correctly verified by the existing dry-run + frame-extraction ritual — genuinely visual/audio correctness that needs eyes, not assertions). But `weekly_digest.py`'s date/threshold arithmetic (cadence windows, unlogged-video buffers) and `analyze_channel.py`'s stats (age-adjusted residuals, distinctive terms) are pure, deterministic, and have already needed two manual recalibrations this week from eyeballing — exactly the class of bug a small `pytest` suite over just those functions would catch for free. Owner scoped this pass to Tier 1+2 (cleanup + structure) and left testing for later; worth revisiting at the next check-in.
- `scripts/` still mixes true one-time tools (`make_sfx.py`, `prep_broll.py`) with recurring CI-invoked scripts (`weekly_analytics.py`, `weekly_digest.py`) and an ad hoc-but-substantial one (`analyze_channel.py`), with no naming/directory convention distinguishing them. Not painful yet at 5 scripts; reconsider if the directory keeps growing.

## Ritual

Run this check-in after each version bump (`FORMAT_VERSION` change in `src/config.py`) or major non-video feature ships (like R4.2). Read the current state fresh — don't assume the last pass's findings still apply — propose tiered findings, get owner scoping, execute, update this file.
